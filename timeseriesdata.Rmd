This data is sourced from goodcarbadcar, the leader in automotive sales data. This data covers 3 years (2019-2021), and is on a monthly time span 

This dataset intrigues me because I currently work as a part time retail worker for Nike and I would like to get into a corporate analyst role. So I believe this will be a good dataset for e to learn on and make my way into a corporate role as an analyst
